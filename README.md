# WolfDec


A Simple Wolf RPG File Decrypter capable of decrypting all current version of *.wolf* files, independent of the systems local setting, i.e., it works without the need to change the system location to Japanese.

The decryption is done using a slightly modified version of
[DxLib](http://dxlib.o.oo7.jp/index.html).

----------

### Usage ###
Just drag and drop one or more *.wolf* file[s] onto the executable to extract them.
